You WILL need Custom Meshes  with the optional files, and Custom Textures as well.

Installation:

As you'll see, the inside of the file are divided into the multiple replacers, and in each, there will be a CustomMeshes and CustomTexture folder (except for the Dyrnwyn)

-You can directly copy and paste the CustomMeshes and Custom Textures folders into your BepInEx > Plugins directory .

-Or manually copy the inside of the folders and directly place them in Valheim's CustomMeshes & CustomTextures directory.


* Dyrnwyn replacer doesn't have textures, because the actual texture of the weapon is the texture of the smoke provoked by the fire. Replacing it make it so the smoke shows the texture file of the weapon instead of smoke.
It's quite funny, but not what I aim at doing,  the fire effect of the sword actually cover most of the weapon, hiding the lack of texture underneat.



A big thanks to Furok, from the Grim Age Mod, without them, these models wouldn't have seen the light of day.

I'm also deeply thankfull to  AeehyehssReeper and Lagrie, their teachings and help made me able to do these mods.


As I am new to Valheim Modding and Blender, If there's any issue, I might not be able to fix them, but I'll always do what I can to give the most support I can !


Future of the mod:
-possibly more replacer ( Axes, more Swords, more Shields, one handed Spears, two handed Spears. )
-possibly turning the items into their own unique items if tools that make it easier comes to life.
